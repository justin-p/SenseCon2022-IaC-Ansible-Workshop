Convert the playbook from the previous exercise to use roles.

1. Use the ansible galaxcy trick and bootstrap tasks from the examples.
2. Replace the nginx installation with a nginx role. Search Ansible-Galaxy/Github for anyone you would like to use. I would recommend [this one.](https://github.com/nginxinc/ansible-role-nginx)
